## 🚀 Getting Started

Since Aura is built with vanilla web technologies, no build process is required.

### Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/aura-productivity.git](https://github.com/yourusername/aura-productivity.git)
    cd aura-productivity
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    * **Simple Method:** Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
    * **PWA Method (Recommended):** To ensure the Service Worker functions correctly, use a local server:
        ```bash
        # Python 3
        python -m http.server 8000
        # Or using VS Code "Live Server" extension
        ```
        Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
